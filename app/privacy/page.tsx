            gitCheck is a small tool built by one developer. The short
            version: we don&apos;t want your data, we don&apos;t sell anything,
            and we don&apos;t keep anything. Here&apos;s the longer version
            so you know exactly what happens when you click Scan.
          </p>

          <Section title="What we actually do when you paste a URL">
            <p>
              When you submit a GitHub repository URL, here&apos;s the exact
              sequence of events:
            </p>
            <ol className="ml-5 mt-4 list-decimal space-y-2 text-muted">
              <li>
                Your browser sends the URL to our server (hosted on Vercel).
              </li>
              <li>
                Our server forwards a request to GitHub&apos;s public API to
                fetch the repository&apos;s file tree and file contents.
              </li>
              <li>
                We run a series of static checks against what we fetched —
                looking for missing privacy pages, default meta titles,
                placeholder text, and so on.
              </li>
              <li>
                We send the results back to your browser and immediately
                discard everything.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="mt-4">
              No database. No logs of what you scanned. No scan history. Once
              the response leaves our server, it&apos;s gone.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="Public repos vs. private repos">
            <p>
              gitCheck handles public and private repositories differently,
              on purpose.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              <strong>Public repos</strong> work with no setup. GitHub allows
              anonymous reads of public repositories, so you just paste a URL
              and click Scan. Nothing else is needed.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              <strong>Private repos</strong> require you to paste a GitHub
              personal access token. The full mechanics are in the next
              section, but the short version is: the token is used once for
              your scan, then discarded. We never see it after the request
              finishes.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="Private repositories — exactly what happens">
            <p>
              If you want to scan a private repo, you paste a GitHub personal
              access token into the scan form. Here&apos;s exactly what
              happens to it:
            </p>
            <ol className="ml-5 mt-4 list-decimal space-y-2 text-muted">
              <li>
                Your browser sends the token over HTTPS to our server. The
                connection is encrypted end-to-end.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our server uses the token to make read requests to GitHub on
                your behalf — fetching the repo tree and a sample of source
                files.
              </li>
              <li>
                We run the same static checks we run on public repos. No
                token-required behavior differs.
              </li>
              <li>
                We return the report to your browser. Your token is never
                included in the response.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Your token is not stored.</strong> Not in a database,
                not in logs, not in analytics, not anywhere. It exists only in
                the memory of the running request, and is garbage-collected
                when the request finishes.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="mt-4">
              We also do not cache scan results for private repos. Public
              scans are briefly cached to speed up share previews; private
              scans are not cached at all, so the report only ever exists in
              your own browser tab.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="What we don't store">
            <p>We do not store, log, or retain any of the following:</p>
            <ul className="ml-5 mt-4 list-disc space-y-2 text-muted">
              <li>The repository URLs you submit</li>
              <li>The code we fetch from those repositories</li>
              <li>The results we generate</li>

              <li>Any cookies, identifiers, or device fingerprints</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4">
              There is no user account system, so there&apos;s nothing to tie
              any of this to a person anyway.
            </p>

          <Section title="Hosting, analytics, and what Vercel sees">
            <p>
              gitCheck is hosted on Vercel. Like every web host, Vercel
              processes each incoming request and may keep short-lived
              operational logs (IP address, timestamp, status code) for
              security and abuse prevention. These logs are owned and managed
              by Vercel, not us, and we don&apos;t have access to them.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              We also use <strong>Vercel Analytics</strong> and{' '}
              <strong>Vercel Speed Insights</strong> to understand basic
              traffic patterns (page views, referrers, performance) so we can
              improve the tool. Both are <strong>cookie-free</strong> and
              don&apos;t collect personal data — no IP addresses stored, no
              cross-site tracking, no user identifiers. That&apos;s why you
              don&apos;t see a cookie banner on this site.
